CYBER ATTACK TYPES AND THEIR PURPOSES
-------------------------------------

Reconnaissance Attacks
----------------------
Port Scanning (nmap):
- Purpose: To discover open "doors" or weaknesses in a target's network.
- Nmap scans systems to identify open ports and running services.
- This helps an attacker plan more targeted attacks by knowing which services might be vulnerable.


Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
-------------------------------
Overall goal:
- To make a target server or service unavailable by overwhelming its resources.

DDoS (SYN flood, UDP flood):

SYN Flood:
- Purpose: To overwhelm a server’s ability to handle new connections.
- The attacker sends many SYN requests but never completes the handshake.
- This fills the server's connection table and prevents legitimate access.

UDP Flood:
- Purpose: To saturate network bandwidth or exhaust system resources.
- Attacker sends massive amounts of UDP packets to random ports.
- The target wastes resources trying to respond, stopping normal traffic.


Man-in-the-Middle & Data Exfiltration Attacks
---------------------------------------------
ARP Spoofing:
- Purpose: To intercept or manipulate network traffic.
- Attacker sends fake ARP messages to redirect data to their machine.
- Enables eavesdropping, modification, or blocking of communications.

SQL Injection (over HTTP):
- Purpose: To steal, manipulate, or delete data from a database.
- Attacker injects malicious SQL commands into a web form.
- The website's database executes the commands, exposing sensitive data.

DNS Tunneling:
- Purpose: To create a secret channel that bypasses firewalls.
- Non-DNS data (e.g., stolen files or commands) is hidden inside DNS traffic.
- Used for command-and-control or covert data exfiltration.


Access and Control Attacks
--------------------------
Brute Force SSH:
- Purpose: To gain unauthorized administrative access to a server.
- The attacker systematically tries many username/password combinations.
- Once successful, they can fully control the system.
