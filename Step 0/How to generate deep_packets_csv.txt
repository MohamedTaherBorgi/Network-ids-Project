This is the dataset that train_model.py uses to produce:
models/anomaly_model.pkl

You need to produce deep_packets.csv containing numerical features extracted from real traffic.
This is done by temporarily using your capture system as a data collector, not as an IDS.

In capture_engine.py, comment out or remove:
self._write_raw(pkt)

Keep only:
self._write_deep(features)

Running:
sudo python3 generate_dataset.py

Generate mixed traffic on the victim

On your victim Ubuntu VM:

Normal traffic:

ping google.com
curl http://example.com
sudo apt update


Port scan (anomalies):

nmap -sS <victim_ip>


Large-payload traffic:

dd if=/dev/urandom bs=500 count=5 | nc <ids_ip> 4444


Do this for 10–20 minutes to collect enough data.
