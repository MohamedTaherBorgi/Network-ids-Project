scapy_capture.py → Fast, lightweight packet capture

Purpose:

Quickly sniff packets

Extract basic features for ML

Very good for high-speed traffic

Does NOT decode layers deeply (Scapy is light)

Output example:

src_ip

dst_ip

src_port

protocol

TTL

flags

packet_size

Used for:
✔ dataset collection
✔ real-time detection
✔ anomaly monitoring

pyshark_capture.py → Deep packet inspection (like Wireshark)

Purpose:

Fully decode packets like Wireshark

Get HTTP requests, DNS queries, TCP seq/ack, etc.

Useful for detailed forensic analysis

Output example:

HTTP method (GET, POST)

DNS query name

TCP window size

TCP sequence number

HTTP URI

ARP MAC addresses

Used for:
✔ debugging attacks
✔ extracting application-layer info
✔ building rich datasets
